;;; shifting extension
;;; by Scott Jaderholm

;;; overview: moves windows around sorting them by most recently accessed
;;; starting from a user designated primary frame that includes the active
;;; window. everytime you select a window it is placed in the primary frame and
;;; other windows are shifted around the other frames. if you have fewer frames
;;; than windows then all non-displayed windows will be placed in the primary
;;; frame behind the active window.
